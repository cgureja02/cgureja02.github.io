      - title: Project Schedular
        content: I developed a Python script that takes a specific date and an integer as arguments, and based on the integer value, adds or subtracts a certain number of days from the date. The script can be used for calculating project timelines, scheduling events, managing deadlines, and tracking important dates.To create the script, I implemented input validation and error handling, and utilized the datetime module in Python. The script requires no external dependencies or libraries to run, and has a user-friendly input format.The project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, problem-solving, and attention to detail. The final deliverable is a fully functional Python script that meets all the project requirements and produces accurate results.
